# Drupal 7 with Selenium
Use Selenium Webdriver to update and perform routine tasks on a Drupal 7 website.

You will need to compile the code for your particular Java setup.

## Drupal Compatability
This has been confirmed to work with Drupal version 7.56.

## YouTube Demonstration and Tutorial
A YouTube series of demonstrating how this code works and the process to building the code will be available in a future video on my YouTube channel.
